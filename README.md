# The Old Wild West: Shantytown
A Wild-West themed text game, in which cowboys must be defeated to complete them game.

## Motivation

  This project stemmed from an idea in my university class, in which we had to create a text-based game in the console that was capable of saving progress.
  After the assingment was submitted, I had an idea to exrapolate on the code I had written for the submission.
  I had just received an authentic cowboy hat, and was inspired to make a wild-west themed game.
  
## Features/Gameplay
  
  This game utilizes the console and user input to play. Progress is saved, and can be loaded if the console is closed.
  The setting of the game takes place in a small town, which will be referred to as shantytown, where the main areas of attraction are the saloon and the gunstore. 
  This game utilizes a form of in-game currency. This currency can be won by defeating bad guys and gambling, and can be spent on new guns and drinks at the bar.
  The saloon has a full bar and a roulette roulette section. As for the bad guys (the cowboys), the saloon is riddled with them.
  Most are normal cowboys, but among them are a few, shall we dub them, Boss Cowboys. Clearly stronger than all those around them, these are beings to be reckoned with.
  As for the gun store, there are several different weapons, which are inspired by different video games. These new guns have improved stats, and can aid in the user to defeat the enemies.
  To summarize, this game offers:
  * Saloon
  * Gun Store
  * Progress Saving
  * Gambling feature
  * Drinking feature
  * Engaging in a draw with various cowboys that find themselves at your mercy in the shantytown

## Technologies

  This game was developed in C++14, using the CLion IDE from JetBrains.
  
## Project Status

  This project is currently finished. Once I learn the skills to implement a GUI, or even to fill the console log screen with gameplay, I will revist this project and implement an improvement for that.
  At the same time, I will refine the game itself. While this was a project designed to test my C++ skills from what I learned in class, it is still not perfect code.
